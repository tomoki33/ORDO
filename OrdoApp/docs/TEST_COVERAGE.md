## Missing Test Areas

### High Priority
1. E2E tests for complete user journeys
2. Performance benchmarking tests
3. Memory leak detection tests

### Medium Priority
1. Snapshot tests for UI consistency
2. Visual regression tests
3. Device-specific behavior tests

### Low Priority
1. Load testing for large datasets
2. Offline behavior testing
3. Internationalization testing

## Test Execution

### Local Development
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test types
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
```bash
# CI test execution
npm run test:ci

# Coverage reporting
npm run test:coverage
```

## Coverage Improvement Plan

### Phase 1 (Current)
- ✅ Core service testing
- ✅ Screen component testing
- ✅ Integration flow testing

### Phase 2 (Next Sprint)
- ⏳ E2E testing setup
- ⏳ Performance testing
- ⏳ Additional screen coverage

### Phase 3 (Future)
- ⏳ Visual regression testing
- ⏳ Cross-platform testing
- ⏳ Advanced scenarios

## Notes

- All tests use React Native Testing Library for consistency
- Mock strategy follows best practices for isolated testing
- Coverage thresholds are enforced in CI/CD pipeline
- Test data is managed through fixtures for maintainability
